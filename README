Possible GCC Bug
----------------

This is a test case to highlight a (possible) bug in gcc 4.3 in SLES11 SP1

Compiled code behaves differently with "-O2 -fPIC" flag combination. Taking
out either of the flags makes the compiled code behave predictably.

Also, commenting out certain lines in the code (highlighted as comments)
makes the code compile predictably even in the presence of "-O2 -fPIC".
